## Description

### Overview

You work for TriGuard Insurance Company and are going to develop a predictive model to identify potential subrogation opportunities in auto insurance claims using historical claim data from 2020-2021. 

**Subrogation** is an important concept in claims. When our policyholder suffers a loss which is not their fault, the claim professional will pay for the loss and refer to the subrogation professional. The subrogation professional will investigate the loss thoroughly to gather evidence to pursue whoever is at fault and try to recover the money from the responsible third party.

**Example:** Our claimant, say driver A, was backing out of a parking space at the same time as another driver, say driver B. Driver A stopped when he noticed but driver B continued to back out and impacted our claimant. TriGuard will pay driver A to fix the car and will seek reimbursement from driver B who is accountable for the loss.

The goal is to determine which claims have a high likelihood of successful subrogation, understand key indicators, and recommend how TriGuard Insurance can use these insights to optimize recovery processes.

### Competition Goals

Your goals in this competition are as follows:

• Identify opportunity of subrogation in first-party physical damage claims.
• Understand key indicators of subrogation opportunity.
• Provide a recommendation on how this information could be leveraged at TriGuard Insurance Company.

### Keywords

- **Claim** – request made by a policyholder to the insurance company for payment or compensation for a covered loss or event.
- **First-party physical damage** – damages sustained by the insured's own property or vehicle.
- **Subrogation Opportunity** – The opportunity that there is a third party to be responsible for the loss.

## Modeling Requirements

Each group may have at most 5 people and will:

a. Work together within groups but not between groups (They can't provide extra info or help – please contact us directly if anything comes up).
b. Build a model to predict subrogation indicator per claim.
c. Submit the prediction of the test data as a csv file. (The format requested is provided in the attachment.)
d. Prepare a presentation for your business partner to summarize your analysis results. You do not need to explain the problem, just summarize what you did and what you found (see questions to answer in section 'Presentation Instructions' below).
e. Each group can make at most 3 submissions per day.

## Benchmark Model

The score from a simple XGBoost model will be the competition benchmark.
