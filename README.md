Description
Overview
You work for TriGuard Insurance Company and going to develop a predictive model to identify potential subrogation opportunities in auto insurance claims using historical claim data from 2020-2021. Subrogation is an important concept in Claim. When our policyholder suffers a loss which is not their fault, the claim professional will pay for the loss and refer to the subrogation professional. The subrogation professional will investigate the loss thoroughly to gather evidence to pursue whoever is that fault and try to recover the money from the responsible third party.

For example, our claimant, say driver A, was backing out of a parking space at the same time as another driver, say driver B. Driver A stopped when he noticed but the driver B continued to back out and impacted our claimant. TriGuard will pay the driver A to fix the car and will seek the reimbursement from driver B who is accountable for the loss.

The goal is to determine which claims have a high likelihood of successful subrogation, understand key indicators, and recommend how TriGuard Insurance can use these insights to optimize recovery processes.

Your goals in this competition are as follows:

• Identify opportunity of subrogation in first-party physical damage claims.
• Understand key indicators of subrogation opportunity.
• Provide a recommendation on how this information could be leveraged at TriGaurd Insurance Company
